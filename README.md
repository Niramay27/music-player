# music player

I made a music player which plays songs that are downloaded on your local pc. The web page looks similar to spotify with fewer features. 
In this project, I have used html,css and javascript.

The page layout is simple html with designs made using css and added functionalities with javascript.

The folder : music_player contains the files of the project. 
index.html -- the layout page with html. 
music.css -- the designs of the page with css. 
music.js -- the page functionalities with js
songs.html -- the html page with list of songs from your local pc. 
The other files in the folder are the images required for the page. 

You can run the code by cloning the files in you pc.
